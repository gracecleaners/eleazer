                    <p>Eleazar African Foundation is a Christian non-profit organization registered as a Ugandan Foreign NGO in October 2020. Our core work is part of the arc of the Kingdom narrative that is centrally about reconciling all things, making right the injustices in the world, and restoring all of creation to health, beauty, and freedom. Our mission is firmly rooted and established in Christ and His love. We are compelled to follow in the footsteps of Jesus into places of brokenness. We embody Christ’s mission and usher in His kingdom of righteousness, justice, and peace. And we are beginning where He began, among the fatherless, widows, sick, oppressed, and poor.</p>

                            <p class="text-light">Steadily increasing numbers of children have been moving away from their families and communities to live and work on the streets. When asked what led these children to move to the streets, the majority cited a combination of push and pull factors. A lack of school fees or academic investment in the children meant many had never stepped foot in a school or dropped out after a few terms. In addition, these children identified violence, abuse, and neglect at home as being a compelling factor that also led them to believe that life on the streets while difficult, would be better than enduring the betrayal trauma and harm inflicted by those meant to love and care for them. While many amazing community organizations are already attempting to reunify street children back to their families, we did not have any organizations actively preventing children from coming out onto the streets. As a result, Eleazar African Foundation developed a strategic plan to stand in the gap to prevent children from coming out onto the streets by directly meeting the needs identified. <br><br>
                            Eleazar African Foundation believes every child deserves to be free from violence, abuse, and neglect and full of play, learning, laughter, and confidence. We are encouraged to provide quality services to fulfill the rights of every child to access education, to participate in cultural and creative activities, to express themselves freely, and to have their basic needs met. Since our humble beginnings, we have adopted a two-pronged approach to coming alongside our children as we champion each of them through two main streams: education and counselling.<br><br>
                            In addition, the Eleazar Center is the first and only outpatient mental health counselling center in Lira city. We offer individual, family, and group counselling to anyone in our community and advocate for the mental health and well-being of all of our neighbors, especially those affected by poverty, trauma, relationship difficulties, and psychopathology. Through our counselling center, we offer deep healing and inner-work to promote health and felt safety, so that we can all live harmoniously and productive.

                                to effectively address these obstacles and limitations. Each child and youth has a unique and
                                powerful story. Simply sharing their stories moves the community to see these children and youth
                                from a different perspective, to develop compassion and empathy, and to actively care for one of

                                dedicated counsellor who will provide individual and family counselling. In addition,
                                vulnerable children and youth are encouraged to participate in group counselling focused
                                on their social-emotional development, relationship skill building, and peacemaking.
                                Counsellors use strengths-focused evidence-based approaches and diverse therapeutic
                                techniques to meet each child’s unique needs. Counsellors provide real-time behavioral
                                coaching to address disciplinary or misbehavior issues that arise during any program
                                activities. Furthermore, our counsellors are also available to meet with members of the
                                community at large who are facing mental health, emotional and social well-being, and

                                youth. We are committed to equipping them to live fully into the purposes that God has
                                called them. To accomplish this, we support vulnerable children and youth to discover
                                their interests and abilities. We nurture the gifts, talents, and skills that vulnerable
                                children and youth naturally possess. For some children and youth, this may involve
                                foundational education in phonics, language development, mathematics, science, and
                                social studies. For others, this will involve developing income-generating skills, such
                                as farming, handicrafts, and business mindedness. We will also seek partnership
                                opportunities with local businesses and skilled artisans to teach employable skills to

                                providers to provide consultation, testing, and vaccinations. As the need arises,
                                beneficiaries may also receive required medical interventions, including treatment for
                                malaria and typhoid, stitches for serious lacerations, and clean dressings for wounds,
                                at local clinics and hospitals. At the Eleazar Center, children develop daily living
                                skills, social skills, and practice healthy hygiene. To encourage regular cleanliness
                                and hygiene practices, vulnerable children and youth are provided with training in basic
                                health practices.</p>

                                families. We facilitate the connection of orphans and vulnerable children with a primary
                                caregiver from among his or her family or clan. We equip these children and their
                                families to stay together through family counselling and facilitate peace processes
                                between youth and their primary caregivers. Through a mindful, intentional process of
                                family reconciliation, we strive to create lasting restoration of family ties and clan
                                relationships. Furthermore, through the initiatives of Eleazar African Foundation,
                                vulnerable children and youth are encouraged to contribute to their local community in
                                positive, life-affirming ways.</p>
